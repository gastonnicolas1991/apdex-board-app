# apdex-board-app

This is a simple Nextjs web application that fetches a list of Apps from an AWS endpoint and shows a list of Hosts where those apps are deployed at.

## üíæ Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:gastonnicolas1991/apdex-board-app.git
cd apdex-board-app
yarn install
yarn dev
```
The application will be running on: http://localhost:3000

‚ö† Check if  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ENABLE='ON' for API data. If any problem, change to 'OFF' for working with the local copy.

## üóÑ ENV

In .env.local we have:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ENABLE='ON'
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ENDPOINT='https://***-public-app-assets.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/host-app-data.json'
```
- (I'm Hiding real endpoint for privacy purposes üòã)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ENABLE allows us to work with MOCK or REAL API DATA. 
- NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ENABLE='ON' -> Api
- NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ENABLE='OFF' -> Mock local data

##  üí™ Structure

The folder structure:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .storybook
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.tsx -> our main page
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.ts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SomeComponent
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.tsx
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.stories.tsx
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.ts
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.test.tsx
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain 
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ redux
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reducer
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ slices
        store.ts
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles
        color.ts
        media.ts (if having responsive media queries)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils
        functions.ts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env.local

```
- **pages**: I usually have a "SomePage" folder with an index.tsx and its styles.ts (if needed).
- **src**: client side.
- **components**: Each new component it's isolated in here and in case of removing it, we remove the WHOLE component (test, story and styling)
- **redux**: Selectors, reducer, slices, store.


## üé® Responsive

I usually use media queries on styled-components stylesheets to manage breakpoints. As it was a requirement to delegate the layout to the user (with a checkbox where he can select grid or list layout) I decided not including any media queries.
Anyway, in any other application I would include a global "media.ts" where it calculates sizes, like this:

```
export const sizes = {
  tablet: 480,
  desktop: 1280,
};

export const breakpoint = {
  tablet: `(min-width: ${sizes.tablet}px)`,
  desktop: `(min-width: ${sizes.desktop}px)`,
};

export const media = {
  tablet: `@media ${breakpoint.tablet}`,
  desktop: `@media ${breakpoint.desktop}`,
};
```

## üîß Tooling

- **Storybook** -> For developing stateless components, check with UI/UX team if the behavior is the expected and also to avoid integration problems at early phases of the development.
- **Redux toolkit** -> For managing state. Once we fetch the data, we need to transform it in a state that we could use and modify. I decided to use Redux for the "remove/add" actions, due to the fact that are related to the user intervention and we need to persist them.
- **NextJs** -> Even if I am not using data fetching from the getServerSideProps, it could have been a very good approach to preload data on server side. (It requires a hard integration with redux, like the **next-redux-wrapper** third party).
- **Styled-components** -> For having a more javascript approach.
- **Typescript**
- **Axios**
- **React testing library**
- **Eslint**


## üìö Storybook

We can see the whole design system. Also, we can interact with some of the behavior like modals.

```bash
cd apdex-board-app
yarn storybook
```
We should see it running on: http://localhost:6006/

## ‚úî Unit Testing

Each component has (or it should have) its own unit testing where I test rendering and basic behavior.
Each function (like utils) is also tested its input and output.

## üîå Services 

In this case we only have this service:
```
GET: https://witbooking-public-app-assets.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/host-app-data.json.
```

## ‚öô Methodology

How did I worked on this challenge?

1) I created a Trello where I put the main tasks to have an idea.
2) I setup the basic tooling.
3) I started first with the storybook and the whole styling requirements.
4) I continued with the componentes and the page integration.
5) I installed redux.
6) I developed the algorithm for mapping from AWS endpoint to client side.
7) I deleted unused files, made typing corrections and worked on this README.

## ü§ñ	Algorithm

### mapFromAppsToHosts


**Big-O notation**: O(N^2) - Quadratic-Time Algorithm
 For each new app, there will be n more iterations (one for each host inside that app).



- This core function maps from server to client side structure.
- I decided to do a nested iteration (like a matrix) and to create a Map structure to be able to access it directly when checking for existence of hosts.
- After the operation, it will be converted into an Array to easily manipulate this (to take advantage of the immutable methods).


üö® If I had to work with a huge list of HOST, I would consider working with a final Map instead of an array, for direct access.

### addAppToHosts and removeAppFromHosts

- These methods adds/removes an app to/from each host.
- There is NO implementation to use this methods in this deliver. 


## Notes 

- ‚ö†Ô∏è I had to enable CORS for the Browser to be able to fetch from theAWS endpoint. I have been digging about it but I could not find easily the correct way to configure it.
- Selectors were not included in Redux folder cause it was necessary for the app, but I normally work with them.
- Tooltip component was an extra idea for showing some extra data when hovering over the list of apps in each host, but it was not implemented for timing.
- I did not integrate any SSR feature, but I consider that It could be a better approach to do the data fetching on server.
- Even if it was required to work with the endpoint on the client side, I would have consider to make the whole transformation on backend side and delivering a more specific response to the client :).
- I tried to commit each "piece of work", but in a real enviroment i would be even more specific and I would also work with branches instead of pushing directly to master of course.
- The loading spinner is missing for timing reasons (even if is not that difficult).
